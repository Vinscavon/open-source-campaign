# Contributing to StackUp
We are glad for your interest and happy to have you contributing to making StackUp the best platform it can be. Before contributing, we would love if you could read the guidelines below. These resources will help you submit issues that are clear, concise and useful for the StackUp team.
# Issue Submission Guidelines
## Types of Issues
We are currently accepting submissions for two types of issues:
- Campaign requests
- Feature requests

Vinscavon

Please only submit requests for campaigns and features that **do not** already exist on the StackUp platform. Additionally, please refrain from submitting other types of issues (e.g. bug reports) as the team will not be addressing them at this time.

## Submitting an Issue
Before submitting an issue, we request that you perform a search using the issue tracker for the keywords that you would use to describe your issue. You may find that your campaign or feature has already been requested by someone else. Please read the results to familiarize yourself with others' suggestions. If your request has already been made by someone else, please do not make it again.

If you find that your issue has not been raised before, you may open a new issue, using our [new issue templates](https://github.com/stackup-dev/open-source-campaign/issues/new/choose) and filling them up.

If your issue has already been raised before, you may choose either to submit a separate issue, or to comment on an existing issue to suggest improvements. 

### Suggesting Improvements to Existing Issues
If you are commenting on an issue that has already been raised, please remember to use language that is polite and professional. Remember that you are commenting on another person's idea.

When suggesting improvements to issues, please make sure to include the following:
1. How the request can be improved (5-7 sentences), e.g. if it is a Campaign Request, explain how the suggested campaign can be improved, what should be added or removed
2. How your suggestion improves the request (5-7 sentences), e.g. if you want to add an additional quest to a campaign, why should this quest be added? If you think a quest does not belong in the campaign, why not?
